All of us devs, at one point or other, would have wanted to have a personal website of our own, either to showcase our online presence or just ‘coz it’s fun. So here, I present you a ready-made Developer Landing Page

Usually creating a personal website would involve buying/registering a domain name, finding a free/paid hosting service, developing your site and uploading it to the hosting provider.

But with GitHub Pages, publishing your site is as easy as drinking a coffee.

* You need a GitHub account (you obviously have one already)
* Create a new repo with the name {username}.github.io
* Clone the repo and create an index.html file
* Add some content and git push

Voila! Your site should be live at ```https://{username}.github.io``` in seconds.
